# Member-Shared Code Repository

This repository is dedicated to housing code that is used across multiple team projects, services, and libraries. By centralizing shared code in a single location, we aim to promote reusability, reduce duplication, and simplify maintenance.

Ideally this includes things like:
  - common error codes
  - shared enums
